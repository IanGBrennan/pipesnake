We developed *pipesnake* as part of the [Australian Amphibian and Reptile Genomics](https://ausargenomics.com/) (*AusARG*) initiative.  **AusARG** is a national collaborative project aiming to facilitate the development of genomics resources for Australia's unique amphibian and reptile fauna. This pipeline was developed specifically as part of the *AusARG Phylogenomics Working Group* with the goal of collecting a consistent set of phylogenomic data for all of Australia's frogs and reptiles, under similar assembly, alignment, and tree estimation procedures. 

*pipesnake* is however, applicable to much broader phylogenomic questions, and is appropriate for processing any sequence-capture or transcriptomic data, so long as the **input is second-generation (short-read) data**.
